# WindowsProgrammingPractices
To practice the basic skill and the logic thinking, 

I use the windows programming with C# to practice.

In these programs, almost of them is the simple game like "pacman", "tetris", etc., 

without very beautiful graphics or animations,

just to increase the programming skills through designing the rules of these games.

# NOTE

The main program is in /WindowsFormAppXX/Program.cs (xx is a number like 1, 2, 3, ...)

and the other programs are in /WindowsFormAppXX/Form1.cs (xx is a number like 1, 2, 3, ...) or Form2.cs

if this practice has more than one windows.
