# WindowsProgrammingPractices
To practice the basic skill and the logic thinking, 

I use the windows programming with C# to practice.

In these programs, almost of them is the simple game like "pacman", "tetris", etc., 

without very beautiful graphics or animations,

just to increase the programming skills through designing the rules of these games.
